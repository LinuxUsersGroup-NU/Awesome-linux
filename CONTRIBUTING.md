## Make sure you agree to the license

Check out the `LICENSE` file and make sure you agree that you are comfortable with sharing your contributions to this list with that license.

## Distributions section

There will be no more distributions added to this section. For the sake of keeping this list short, only top 10 distributions from Distrowatch's list [for the last 12 months](http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=popularity) will be included. Also, to avoid personal opinions about them, the Distrowatch descriptions are copied. If you think they're outdated or short, please contact Distrowatch and let me know.

## Learning Resources section

You have to submit _only_ the content you have actually consumed. You will need to add your personal opinion on why do you think this learning resource is awesome for it to be included in this list.

### Books subsection

To add new content to the books section, follow this syntax:

```gfm

#### [Name of the book](link to the Goodreads page of the book) [Average Goodreads rating]

Your personal comment on why do you think this book is awesome and relative to this list. - [@your-github-profile](link to your GitHub profile)

> Goodreads description
```

Also, feel free to add your own comment on the book already included in this list.

### Courses subsection

This is the only subsection of the Learning Resources section that allows you to add distribution-specific learning resources.

Syntax:

```gfm

#### [Name of the course](link to the course) [$price]

Short personal description. - [@your-github-profile](link to your GitHub profile)

```

## X Desktop Environments section

The screenshots are borrowed from their official websites or from Wikipedia.

Only four biggest ones will have its own subsection and a screenshot. If you want to add new X Desktop Environment, add them in the Other Desktop Environments subsection by following this syntax:

```gfm
* [Name](link) - short description copied from Arch Wiki.
```

Be sure to add them in the alphabetical order.

## X Windows Managers

Follow this syntax:

```gfm
* [Name](link) - Short description
```

There are currently no proposed rules for adding content to this section because I'm not very experienced in using them. If you want propose some rule, feel free to do so by creating an issue.

## Applications

Added applications should be regularly updated. They should also be usable and fairly stable at the time of adding them.

To add applications to other GUI-based applications sub-section, follow this guide:

```gfm
* [name](official website) (**desktop environment**) - Short description
```

where `official website` should be replaced with the link to the application (link to the repo containing the code if the website doesn't exist) and `desktop environment` should be replaced with the DE they're supposed to work with the best.

Once there is at least five applications specifically designed for other desktop environments, their subsection will be added.

To add applications to any other subsection, follow this syntax:

```gfm
* [name](official website) - Short description
```

Again, you should link to the code repo if the website doesn't exist.

## Useful Websites section

To add new content to the websites section, follow this syntax:

```gfm

#### [name of the website](link to the website)

> A paragraph or two copied from the website itself.

```

If you can't find a paragraph that fully explains the website, then follow this syntax:

```gfm

#### [name of the website](link to the website)

Personal comment on why this website is awesome. - [@your-github-profile](link to your github profile)

```

Please keep in mind that the distro-specific websites **will not be included**. You can only add general-purpose Linux websites to this list.

Keep in mind that this subsection values quality over quantity.

## Adding a new category

If you think that this list needs a new section, you're probably right.

In that case, please create an issue and explain why do you think that this category should make it to the list. If there's more people supporting your opinion, feel free to create a pull request.
